         Turns the filters form the filter's config files into url parameters by matching the filter id and data against
         the filter patterns below. A wildcard ("*") matches any value as long as it exists and isn't empty.
         The parameters will later be added to the end of the base repo webscript url used to retrieve the values.

         Note that it is possible to create dynamic values by using the following keys inside "{}":
          * {id} - resolves to the filter id value
          * {data} - resolveds to the filter data value
          * {0dt} - resolves to a iso08601 datetime representation of the current date and time
          * {0d} -  resolves to a iso8601 date respresentation of the current day
          * {-7d} -  resolves to a iso8601 date respresentation of the current day rolled the given number of days back
          * {+7d} -  resolves to a iso8601 date respresentation of the current day rolled the given number of days forward
