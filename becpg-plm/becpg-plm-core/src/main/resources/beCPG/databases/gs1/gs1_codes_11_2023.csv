The clasp serves two purposes: to form a closed loop thereby properly fastening the pin to whatever it is applied to, and to cover the end of the pin to protect the user from the sharp point.  Safety pins are commonly used to fasten pieces of fabric or clothing together. Safety pins, or more usually a special version with an extra safe cover, called a nappy pin were widely used to fasten cloth diapers (nappies), as the safety clasp prevents the baby from being jabbed. Similarly, they can be used to patch torn or damaged clothing. Safety pins can also be used as an accessory or jewelry, such as earrings, chains, and wristbands.

A treasury tag is a lace with a sharp metal tag at one end which could be threaded through the holes in a stack of documents or cards and then inserted into a female tag at the other end to form a loop, so binding the documents. The tags in that case were in line with the string, like a shoelace. An India tag was similar but the metal tags were orthogonal to the string, so forming a cross-piece.

The term ""4K"" refers to a horizontal resolution of approximately 4,000 pixels. The use of width to characterise the overall resolution marks a switch from previous television standards such as 480i and 1080p, which categorise media according to its vertical dimension. Using that same convention, 4K UHD would be named 2160p since it has twice the horizontal and vertical resolution of 1080p.

It is an anion with the chemical formula HCO3. Bicarbonate serves a crucial biochemical role in the physiological pH buffering system. Bicarbonate is a major element in our body, and is present in all body fluids and organs. Secreted by the stomach, it is necessary for digestion. When ingested, for example, with mineral water, it helps buffer lactic acid generated during exercise and also reduces the acidity of dietary components. Finally, it has a prevention effect on dental cavities. - UOM for Nutrient Panel: - GS1 Notes, Keywords, and Examples: - GS1 Comment: GS1 temporary code - GS1 Synonyms: ;CODEVALUE;Shared;;NEW;CURRENT;1

The regional origin of the products ensures an additional ecological advantage of the products. The rationality promotes short transport and marketing channels. The independent checks of food by authorized inspection bodies and the additional supervision by the sign holder ensure a high degree of credibility of the sign. The control number printed on the products makes the controls comprehensible.
The seal clearly shows the consumer that the agricultural products and products come from Baden-Württemberg. This ensures not only that the processing takes place in the region, but also that the sourcing of raw materials is 100% regional. In the production and processing of food, the guidelines of the EU Organic Regulation are used as the basis. Many products that are labelled with the Baden-Württemberg organic label are also produced according to the stricter guidelines of an organic farming association. The farms participating in the Bio-Zeichen Baden-Württemberg must be 100% organic. A partial conversion is - with the exception of products from the orchard - not permitted.

The certification, simple and understandable by all, is the result of a collective approach of actors who wish to work together to promote the ""produce in France"" and the valorization of industrial and artisan know-how.

The Pro France association which promotes Origine France Garantie is made up of business leaders supporting this initiative. Its goal is:

Give clear and precise information to the consumer about the French origin of the products
Make known the companies that manufacture in France
The Origine France Garantie certification distinguishes itself from other mentions such as ""made in France"", ""designed in France"", ""Made in France"" ... which are self-declarative and too loose.

Origine France Garantie is the only certification that certifies the French origin of a product. It is transversal (all sectors combined) and indisputable (certification, mandatory, is carried out by an independent certifying body).

The Origine France Garantie certification ensures consumers traceability of the product by giving a clear and objective indication of origin.

Certification is achieved through two cumulative criteria that companies must meet to obtain it:

Between 50% and 100% of the unit cost is French
The product takes its essential characteristics in France";CODEVALUE;GDSN;;NEW;CURRENT;9
